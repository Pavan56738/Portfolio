                Hi there, welcome to my website! I'm Pavankalyan,
                a passionate web developer who enjoys learning new technologies
                and solving problems with code!
            </h3>
            <p></p>
            <h3>1. General Introduction</h3>
            <p>
               Hello! My name is <strong>Pavankalyan</strong>, and I am a passionate <strong>Front-End Developer and Full Stack Developer</strong>. 
    My journey in technology began with a curiosity to design beautiful, user-friendly interfaces, and over time, it evolved into building complete, 
    scalable web applications. With a strong foundation in front-end technologies and a solid grasp of backend development, I strive to bring ideas 
    to life through clean code, creativity, and functionality. 
            </p>
            <h3>2. Roles & Responsibilities as FSD</h3>
            <p>
                As a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>, I take on diverse responsibilities that span across both the client and server sides of an application. 
    On the <em>front-end</em>, I specialize in designing responsive and interactive user interfaces using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 
    modern frameworks such as React (or Angular/Vue if you use them). On the <em>back-end</em>, I work with Node.js, Express, and database systems like 
    MongoDB or MySQL to handle server logic, API integration, and data management. I also manage deployment and version control to ensure smooth 
    project delivery.</p>
             <h3>3. Skills & Strengths</h3>
  <p>
    My strongest skills lie in <strong>front-end development</strong>, where I excel in creating intuitive and visually appealing designs that 
    enhance user experience. I am highly skilled in <strong>JavaScript, React, and responsive design</strong>. Beyond the interface, I am also 
    experienced in <strong>backend development</strong> with Node.js and Express, working with databases such as MongoDB and MySQL. 
    My ability to work across the full stack allows me to build complete web applications, from concept to deployment.
  </p>
  
  <h3>4. My Learning Journey</h3>
  <p>
    My development journey has been a continuous cycle of learning and improving. I started by mastering the basics of front-end development, 
    learning how to structure layouts with HTML, style them with CSS, and add interactivity with JavaScript. From there, I expanded into modern 
    frameworks and libraries that streamlined my workflow. As I grew more confident, I ventured into back-end technologies, learning how servers, 
    APIs, and databases work together. This progression allowed me to become a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>, capable of delivering 
    end-to-end solutions.
  </p>
  
  <h3>5. Personal Values & Hobbies</h3>
  <p>
    Beyond coding, I believe in <strong>teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving</strong>. I enjoy collaborating with others, exchanging ideas, 
    and building projects that make a real difference. In my personal time, I like <strong>photography, gaming, blogging, traveling</strong>, 
    which keep me inspired and help me maintain a balance between creativity and technology.
